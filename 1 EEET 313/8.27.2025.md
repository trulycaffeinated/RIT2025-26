##### Modulation Process
Information signal cannot be transmitted directly
- Too low of a frequency (e.g. voice signal is 20 - 3000 Hz)
- Requires too long of an antenna
- Requires a great deal of power to transmit

Modulation process takes the information and puts it onto a "carrier" signal that is more easily transmitted
- That carrier is a radio signal at a specific frequency, typically much g
