##### Modulation Process
Information signal cannot be transmitted directly
- Too low of a frequency (e.g. voice signal is 20 - 3000 Hz)
- Requires too long of an antenna
- Requires a great deal of power to transmit

Modulation process takes the information and puts it onto a "carrier" signal that is more easily transmitted
- That carrier is a radio signal at a specific frequency, typically much higher than the information frequency. That carrier signal can be sent, unlike the information signal
- Modulation is the process of going from information to carrier
- Demodulation is the process of going from carrier to information

**The carrier is basically the "envelope" of the information signal, with the information being the letter inside.**

If I wanted to transmit an electrical signal with audio (20 to 3000 Hz) it would require an antenna 100's to 1000's of miles long. (And lots of power)

Higher frequency signals travel (propagate) better - frequency is inversely proportional to antenna length. The higher the frequency the smaller the antenna needed.

A carrier is a sinusoidal signal at a frequency higher than that of the information signal.
Examples...
- WITR FM at 89.1 MHz
- 5G Wifi at 5.180 MHz
- BBC World Service at 1323 kHz
- GPS at 1575.42 MHz
- Bluetooth at ~2.480 MHz

Magnitude is the magnitude of the phasor (B)
Peak magnitude is of both real and imaginary parts
Phase is the angle $\theta$ of the phasor at any given time
Frequency is the rate of rotation around the circle
- In cycles per second
- One cycle is a rotation of $2\pi$ radians per second

##### What properties can we change/modulate
We can change - both individual components and multiple of these components
- Frequency
- Amplitude
- Phase

As long as you know what you modulated (changed) you can demodulate it to get the information back

*Depending on what you're doing, different changes may be better than others...*
Example with radio
- AM radio at 535kHz to 1705kHz
- FM radio at 88.0MHz to 108.0MHz
- XM radio at 2320MHz to 2345MHz

Combination of modifying magnitude and phase is called QAM Modulation

Mathematically represent the carrier with time varying components both phase and amplitude

	let $\theta(t)$ be time varying phase

$v(t) = v_p(t)*e^{j\theta(t)}$

Missing some stuff

$$
\theta(t) = \omega t + symbol = 2\pi
