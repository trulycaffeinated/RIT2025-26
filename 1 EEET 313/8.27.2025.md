##### Modulation Process
Information signal cannot be transmitted directly
- Too low of a frequency (e.g. voice signal is 20 - 3000 Hz)
- Requires too long of an antenna
- Requires a great deal of power to transmit

Modulation process takes the information and puts it onto a "carrier" signal that is more easily transmitted
- That carrier is a radio signal at a specific frequency, typically much higher than the information frequency. That carrier signal can be sent, unlike the information signal
- Modulation is the process of going from information to carrier
- Demodulation is the process of going from carrier to information

**The carrier is basically the "envelope" of the information signal, with the information being the letter inside.**

If I wanted to transmit an electrical signal with audio (20 to 3000 Hz) it would require an antenna 100's to 1000's of miles long. (And lots of power)

Higher frequency signals travel (propagate) better - frequency is inversely proportional to antenna length. The higher the frequency the smaller the antenna needed.

A carrier is a sinusoidal signal at a frequency higher than that of the information signal.
