##### Modulation Process
Information signal cannot be transmitted directly
- Too low of a frequency (e.g. voice signal is 20 - 3000 Hz)
- Requires too long of an antenna
- Requires a great deal of power to transmit

Modulation process takes the information and puts it onto a "carrier" signal that is more easily transmitted
- That carrier is a radio signal at a specific frequency, typically much higher than the information frequency. That carrier signal can be sent, unlike the information signal
- Modulation is the process of going from information to carrier
- Demodulation is the process of going from carrier to information

**The carrier is basically the "envelope" of the information signal, with the information being the letter inside.**
