# Gain, Decibels, and Loss
---
Decibels in Communications
A wide range of signal levels are found in communications systems
Example : Two-Way radio
- Transmitter output power - 100 Watts ($10^2$)
- receiver input levels -- femtowatts

Easier to compare values in the form of logarithm of the ratio of values
	This is decibel notations
	Named for Alexander Graham Bell

Used for comparisons of
- Power, voltage, current, sound level
- Can represent system gains and losses
- Can represent absolute levels of power voltages or current
