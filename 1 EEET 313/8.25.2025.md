### Course Project
**AM Transmitter and receiver pair** - Each lab is a section of this project

# Intro
Common elements
- Transmit\Receive
- Encode\Decoding protocols

All will be transmitting over the air
Current goes into a wire, goes into a electromagnetic wave, wave will pass over another wire, induce a current in that wire, and that current becomes a processable signal

Variety of signal strengths and distances - Inches, Feet, Miles, Mars and Back

Direction
- One way - broadcast
- Two way one at a time - Half duplex - walkie talkies
- Two way same time - Full duplex - phone

Different mediums
- Free space "Ether" - radio wireless
	- Infrared light
- Coaxial cables
- Optical Fiber
- Household wiring
- Water - submarine communications
Each system has different constraints and challenges
