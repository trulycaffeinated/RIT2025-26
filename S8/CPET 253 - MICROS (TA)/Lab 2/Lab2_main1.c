         CPET253 Lab2 - State Machines

 Jeanne Christman
 original version 6/28/2023

 This program uses a state machine to display a light show using the multi-colored LED on 
	the MSP432 Launchpad board 
 The sequence of the light show is Green (1 sec), red (.75 sec), blue (1 sec), purple (.75 sec)
	and repeats continuously

 The multi-colored LED is controlled by Port2, pin0(red), pin1(green) and pin2 (blue) 
	Constants are declared for each color
	
Functions called:
	Clock_Init48MHz();   //from Clock.c - sets bus clock to 48Mhz
	Clock_Delay1ms(x);   //from Clock.c - creates a delay of x ms
	Port2_Init();        //from Init_Ports.c - initializes Port2 pins
	LED_color(x);        //written as part of the lab - sets the LED color according to input x
 
The state machine has 4 states
