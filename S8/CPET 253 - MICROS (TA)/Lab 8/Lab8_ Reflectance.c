// Reflectance.c
// Provide functions to take measurements using the kit's built-in
// QTRX reflectance sensor array.  Pololu part number 3672. This works by outputting to the
// sensor, waiting, then reading the digital value of each of the
// eight phototransistors.  The more reflective the target surface is,
// the faster the voltage decays.
