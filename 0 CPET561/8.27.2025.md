# SOPC and Cores
### Designing a SOPC
![[SOPC_Design.png]]

##### Hard Cores
ARM - Hard processor
High Speed Serial Interfaces - TX / RX
Memory - RAM/ROM
General I/O - every pin goes through an I/O buffer and can be used as input/output

When programming an FPGA, you take up space around those components. Trace lengths for components will be different, which can/will cause timing issues.

**Moore's Law** - the number of transistors that can be placed on an integrated circuit has approx. doubles every two years

In 1985 the first FPGA was developed (Field-Programmable Gate Array)

System on Programmable Chip (SOPC) was born

SOPC vs Custom IC
- Shorter lead times (+)
- Lower NRE (+)
- Design changes are easy to reprogram (+)
- Higher power (-)
- Cost is constant despite volume
	- Good for small volumes, bad for large volumes
- Have to choose from off the shelf parts (-)
	- Not optimized

System on programmable chip typically includes
- Intellectual Property Processor Core
- Custom Hardware
	- Timers
	- Serial communication interfaces (UART, SPI)
	- General Purpose I/O
	- Digital Signal Processing functions
	- communications peripherals
	- Off chip device interfaces
- Application specific hardware developed by user
