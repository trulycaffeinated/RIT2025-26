# SOPC and Cores
**Moore's Law** - the number of transistors that can be placed on an integrated circuit has approx. doubles every two years

In 1985 the first FPGA was developed (Field-Programmable Gate Array)

System on Programmable Chip (SOPC) was born

SOPC vs Custom IC
- Shorter lead times (+)
- Lower NRE (+)
- Design changes are easy to reprogram (+)
- Higher power (-)
- Cost is constant despite volume
	- Good for small volumes, bad for large volumes
- Have to choose from off the shelf parts (-)
	- Not optimized
	-
