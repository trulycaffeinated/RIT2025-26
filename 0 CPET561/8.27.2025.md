# SOPC and Cores
### Designing a SOPC
![[SOPC_Design.png]]

##### Hard Cores
ARM - Hard processor
High Speed Serial Interfaces - TX / RX
Memory - RAM/ROM
General I/O - every pin goes through an I/O buffer and can be used as input/output

When programming an FPGA, you take up space around those components. Trace lengths for components will be different, which can/will cause timing issues.

##### Soft Cores
Something provided to you that you may not have a lot of knowledge of, drivers, controllers, etc.
Take that driver and place it somewhere, pray tool can put it all together.

##### User Logic
All this stuff you program

Tool will automatically put all these things together, but you can manually design the inside of the chip for manual routing. Useful for fixing timing.

### System Partitioning
In general, software is typically 20-30x slower than hardware, due to the stages that software needs to go through at the clock pace.

# Actually Day 2 stuff

**Moore's Law** - the number of transistors that can be placed on an integrated circuit has approx. doubles every two years 
![[MooresLawGraph.png]]

In 1985 the first FPGA was developed (Field-Programmable Gate Array) leads to the System on Programmable Chip (SOPC) was born

SOPC vs Custom IC
- Shorter lead times (COTS Part - Commercial Off The Shelf Part)(+)
- Lower NRE (Non Reoccurring Engineering)(+)
- Design changes are easy to reprogram (+)
- Higher power (-)
- Cost is constant despite volume
	- Good for small volumes, bad for large volumes
- Have to choose from off the shelf parts (-)
	- Not optimized

PLD - Programmable Logic Devices
CPLD - Complex PLD

System on programmable chip typically includes
- Intellectual Property Processor Core
- Custom Hardware
	- Timers
	- Serial communication interfaces (UART, SPI)
	- General Purpose I/O
	- Digital Signal Processing functions
	- communications peripherals
	- Off chip device interfaces
- Application specific hardware developed by user

### IP Cores in SOPC
In this class we will be using a TON of Intel IP

IP - refers to creations of the mind
	Inventions, Literary and artistic works, and symbols, names, images and designs
What are IP Cores?
- Ready made function that can instantiate your design
- Cores classified as either hard or soft
	- Hard cores
		- Design is dedicated circuitry design in silicon
	- Soft Cores
		- Designed using LE and general FPGA logic
		- Does not physically exist in silicon
- Cores
