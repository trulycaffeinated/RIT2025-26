# Nios II Processor

### Architectures
**CISC**
Complex Instruction Set Computer
- Processors that are easy to program and make efficient use of memory
- Earliest machines were programmed in assembly language and memory was slow and expensive
	- Big programs require a lot of memory \$\$\$\$
**CISC developed to make compiler development simpler**
- Shifts burden of generating machine instruc

**RISC**
