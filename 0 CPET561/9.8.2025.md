# Nios II Processor

### Architectures
**CISC**
Complex Instruction Set Computer
- Processors that are easy to program and make efficient use of memory
- Earliest machines were programmed in assembly language and memory was slow and expensive
	- Big programs require a lot of memory \$\$\$\$
**CISC developed to make compiler development simpler**
- Shifts burden of generating machine instructions to the processor
- Ex: Instead of compiler writing long machine instructions to calculate a sqrt

**RISC**
Reduced Instruction Set Computer
- Processor architecture that uses small, highly-optimized set of instructions
RISC Characteristics 
- One cycle execution time
	- RISC processors have a CPI (Clock per instruction executed)
- Pipelining
	- Simultaneous 
- Large number of registers
