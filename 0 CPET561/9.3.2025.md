## Assembly

Low level programming language for a computer
one-to-one correspondence
Specific to given processor
- Mnemonics to represent the names of low-level machine instructions
- Labels o represent the names of variables or memory addresses
- directives to define data and constraints
- Macros to facilitate the inline expansion of text into other code

**Commonly used directive**
- .ascii "string" - string of ASCII characters is loaded into consecutive byte addresses in memory. 
- .asciz "string" - same as .ascii, except that each string is terminated by zero
- .data - identifies data that should be placed in data
- .end - end of source code file
- .equ *symbol, expression* - defining a variable / constant - done at compile time - cannot change
- .global *symbol* - makes symbol visible outside assembled object file
- .include "filename" - just including header files, .include's are copy-pastes
- .space *size*
- .text - identifies where code starts
- .word *expression* - similar to .byte expression

```assembly
#Each one of these values are going to stored as a binary signed representation 32-bit number
.word 4, 7, -5, 6
```

##### Labels
Represents the memory address of the data or instruction marked with that label
**A pointer to that location in memory**

```assembly
loop: #read from r2 and store to r3
	ldbio r4, 0(r2) #0 is an offset of r2 - 0 bytes away from r2
	stbio r4, 0(r3)
	br loop
```
When this code is assembled, the memory address of the ldbio instruction will be inserted in the br instruction

##### Registers
Stick to registers r2-r23

r0 is 0x00000000 - used for resets and comparing
