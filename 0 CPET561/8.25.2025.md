**Embedded System** - Any system that includes a programmable computer, but i not a general purpose computer itself

A microprocessor based system
#### Issues
Is a phone an embedded system? The line is blurry - you can write new code for a phone, so yes? But the phone has a defined purpose, so no?

**Embedded System**
- Specific Application that is known at design time
- Not programmable by user
- Optimized for fixed run time requirements
- Criteria
	- Cost
	- Reliability
	- Power Consumption
	- Size

**Components of Embedded System**

### What does a processor look like?

Giant ass state machine

Fetch -> Decode -> Execute -> Mem Access -> Write Back -> Fetch

```mermaid
flowchart TB
	A[Fetch] ---> B[Decode]
	B ---> C[Execute]
	C ---> D[Mem Access]
	D ---> E[Write Back]
	E ---> A
```

**Fetch** - get instruction
**Decode** - decode/interpret instruction 
- Example...
  and r3,r2,r1 (and r1,r2, store in r3)
  Decode has the instruction and registers, but pulls the data from the registers
  **Fetch has instruction, decode pulls any required data**
**Execute** - Perform instruction (math/logic/etc)
**Mem access** - get and put from/in memory
**Write Back** - Loop back to next instruction

#### Characteristics (see slides for more depth)
1. Dependable
2. Efficient (most run off of batteries)
3. Must meet Real-Time constraints
	- A real time system must react to stimuli immediately
	- Must finish operations by deadlines
4. Time-To-Market constraints
	- Typically 6-8 months

##### Application Specific Integrated Circuit

- Very Large Scale Integration (not actually large scale) 
- Device created with specific purpose
- Typically designed and used by single company
- Development expensive, time consuming, & resource intensive
- High performance coupled with low power consumption
- Algorithm or design fixed in silicon

If an issue arises in the VHDL, then every ASIC will have that issue 

ASIC is typically best for mass production and not much else

##### System on Chip

- ASIC or ASSP that contains one or more processors
- Also contains other stuff
- Algorithm

##### Field Programmable Gate Array

- Programmable logic device that is configured by designer
- Development is inexpensive and easier to perform
- High power consumption with lower performance

This semester we will be working on soft core processors in an FPGA
Combining a soft core processor with a custom FPGA design working together in a SOPC (System on Programmable Chip)

Custom ASIC has a huge lead time (time until shipping/arrival)
