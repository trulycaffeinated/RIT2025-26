**Embedded System** - Any system that includes a programmable computer, but i not a general purpose computer itself

A microprocessor based system

#### Issues
Is a phone an embedded system? The line is blurry - you can write new code for a phone, so yes? But the phone has a defined purpose, so no?

**Embedded System**
- Specific Application that is known at design time
- Not programmable by user
- Optimized for fixed run time requirements
- Criteria
	- Cost
	- Reliability
	- Power Consumption
	- Size
