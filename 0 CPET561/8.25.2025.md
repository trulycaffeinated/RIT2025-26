**Embedded System** - Any system that includes a programmable computer, but i not a general purpose computer itself

A microprocessor based system

#### Issues
Is a phone an embedded system? The line is blurry - you can write new code for a phone, so yes? But the phone has a defined purpose, so no?

**Embedded System**
- Specific Application that is known at design time
- Not programmable by user
- Optimized for fixed run time requirements
- Criteria
	- Cost
	- Reliability
	- Power Consumption
	- Size

**Components of Embedded System**

### What does a processor look like?

Giant ass state machine

Fetch -> Decode -> Execute -> Mem Access -> Write Back -> Fetch

**Fetch** - get instruction
**Decode** - decode/interpret instruction 
- Example...
  and r3,r2,r1 (and r1,r2, store in r3)
  Decode has the instruction and registers, but pulls the data from the registers
  **Fetch has instruction, decode pulls any required data**
**Execute** - Perform instruction (math/logic/etc)
**Mem access** - get and put from/in memory
**Write Back** - Loop back to next instruction

#### Characteristics (see slides for more depth)
1. Dependable
2. Efficient (most run off of batteries)
3. Must meet Real-Time constraints
	- A real time system must react to stimuli immediately
	- Must finish operations by deadlines
4. Time-To-Market constraints
	- Typically 6-8 months

**Application Specific Integrated Circuit**

- Very Large Scale Integration (not actually large scale) 
- Device created with specific purpose
- Typically designed and used by single company
- Development expensive, time consuming, & resource intensive
- High performance coupled with low power consumption
- Algorithm or design fixed in silicon

If an issue arises in the VHDL, then every ASIC
